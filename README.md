# setDevEnv
just a bash script that do for me all apt-get install needed to setup my dev environment like IDE, runtime and many package that i need :)

you can clone it if you want to modify it as you want.

the script install for me ZSH set also OH-MY-ZSH in the $HOME directory.

install nodejs but NOT npm, install yarn, git, build-essential, cmake gcc and others needed package to build from source like cmake
